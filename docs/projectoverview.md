# Support for MD
Does the github pages support gh flavored markdown? I would guess so.

# contents of a project website
- Team name and area
- a list of the three problem spaces being explored
- A team members page that links to a profile page for each team member, with some information for public consumption.  *PII can be redacted if students wish to do so since the site is public*
- an email address where interested parties who stumble across the website can send info to find out more about team members or how they can get involved if the problem spaces resonate.    Here I would recommend creating a new gmail account for the project.

# contents of the repository
- each team member should commit their profile page.  this means each team member should have github account and commit the information
- it's fine (and encouraged) for a one person on a team to create a template page that others can copy/checkout/modify and commit.

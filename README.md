# Issues
Issues are catagorized using a method that will be explained shortly on the site.  They include a way to tag scenarios, storys, enhancments, and bugs.

# Issue types related to your project.
## Scenarios
Scenarios describe a discrete set of functionality the user of the software does to accomplish a given goal in a particular context.
## Stories
Stories are agile stories.  Discrete bits of functionality implemented to accomplish a scenario.  Stories are written from the end user's perspective and can be discretely implemented and tested
## Enhancements
Enhancements are features.  I use the tag enhancements because it's there by default in github.  Its a discrete portion of an implementation that supports a story.
## Bugs
These are deficiencies in enhancements that keep it from fully supporting the stories and scenarios.
